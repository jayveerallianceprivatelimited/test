This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.

In a real project, you would replace this text file with an actual favicon image in ICO format.

To create a proper favicon:
1. Design a square icon (typically 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixels)
2. Convert it to .ico format using an online converter like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
3. Replace this placeholder file with your actual favicon.ico file
4. For optimal browser support, consider creating multiple sizes and formats

For this dashboard project, consider using an icon that matches your brand or the dashboard's theme.
